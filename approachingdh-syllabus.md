## Course Description

This course provides an encounter with the epistemological ground underlying the digital humanities (DH), asking how the use of technology in humanities contexts can offer new ways of knowing. The argument of the class is that technology is not simply an additive element to humanities inquiry, but rather that it can unsettle existing ways of thinking in ways that are both helpful and potentially troubling. Our emphasis will be on the various models of knowledge used in the digital humanities, and on the larger ramifications of those approaches for the field of literary studies in particular and the academy in general. Among the questions we will consider are: to what extent can hypothesis-driven computational inquiries help us make arguments about literary history? In what ways can quantitative text experiments avoid positivist forms of argumentation through the use of Dadaist or Oulipean models? To what extent can various DH approaches and methods be grounded in issues of race, class, gender, and sexuality? How can publication venues and review processes in the humanities account for and represent non-textual knowledge?
 
Among the thematics we will explore are evidence, scale, representation, genre, quantification, and data. Though no previous technical skills are required, students will be asked to experiment in introductory ways with DH tools and methods as a way of concretizing some of our readings and discussions. Readings will include work by Johanna Drucker, Lauren Klein, Alan Liu, Ted Underwood, Tressie McMillan Cottom, Todd Presner, Stephen Ramsay, Kim Gallon, Andrew Piper, Andrew Goldstone, Tara McPherson, and others. 

DH skeptics are welcome. In lieu of the final paper, first-year students may write a review essay in preparation for the program's first exam.

## Assignments ##

**Annotated Bibliography & Presentation** <br />
(Sign up coming soon) <br />
Choose a research topic related to the course and find texts (at least 5 for students in the 2-credit version of the course and at least 10 for students in the 4-credit version) related to it (articles or books count equally as a text). For each text, provide a bibliographical citation in MLA format and a 1-2 paragraph description of the text. Your description should gloss the argument/contribution of the text in question and should also explain its relevance to your research topic. Be sure to explore academic databases from the GC Library such as the MLA International Bibliography as you are doing research. For more on writing an annotated bibliography, please see this resource: http://guides.library.cornell.edu/annotatedbibliography.

Your annotated bibliography is due on the date of your presentation. It should be posted to our course blog in the “Annotated Bibliographies” category, tagged with terms related to your topic. In your presentation, you should introduce us to your research topic and walk us through the sources you’ve explored.

**Praxis Assignments**<br />
Once during the semester, I will ask you to experiment with a hands-on activity that involves either mapping or text analysis. These exercises are meant to be beginner-level; my interest in having you complete them lies in getting you to do some early-stage computational/mapping work. Your results do not have to be necessarily significant or meaningful; the important thing is to engage the activity and gain a better understanding of the kinds of choices one must make when undertaking such a project. Please limit the amount of time you spend on this, and as you work through the assignment, keep in mind the kinds of epistemological and interpretative questions these methods help you ask, and how those questions differ from other modes of literary analysis.

**Blog Posts**<br />
Create a post on our course blog related to our readings. You might provide a reaction to something we’ve read; share resources related to the course; or work through ideas related to our class discussions. For more on academic blogging, please consult this guide: http://twp.duke.edu/sites/twp.duke.edu/files/file-attachments/blogging-introduction.original.pdf

**3 Page Reflection Paper**<br />
Write a short three-page paper on a topic related to our course readings. My interest here is seeing you engage our readings in a critical way. Try to pick out key terms, phrases, and concepts from our readings and position your own thoughts within a wider set of arguments.

**Final Presentation**<br />
On May 8, you will be asked to give a 5-7 minute presentation on your final paper project. You should introduce the class to the subject of your research and begin to describe the argument you are making in your paper. Not required of auditors.

**Final Paper or Project**<br />
Your final paper (20-25 pages; not required of auditors or 2-credit students) should explore a topic of research related to the course materials. You should submit a short (no more than one page) proposal about your topic on April 24. In your paper, focus particularly on your argument; discuss sources insofar as they help you advance your argument, but make sure that throughout the paper (and particularly in your transition sentences at the beginning of every paragraph), you are putting the focus on the argument you are trying to make.

Should you wish to create a digital project of some kind for this class rather than a final paper, please meet with Prof. Gold to discuss. First-year students in English may write a review essay in accordance with the guidelines for the First Exam in lieu of the final paper. https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Doctoral-Programs/English/Resources#III.B1
